# BirdNET Package

The BirdNET package forms the core of the BirdNET-Go application, providing functionality for bird species identification using machine learning techniques. This package interfaces with TensorFlow Lite models to analyze audio data and identify bird species based on their sounds.

## Package Overview

The package implements the following key functionalities:

- Loading and initialization of TensorFlow Lite models for bird species recognition
- Audio sample processing and analysis
- Species probability calculation and filtering based on geographic location and time of year
- Results queuing and processing for downstream consumption
- Taxonomy integration with eBird taxonomy codes

## Core Components

### BirdNET Struct

The main structure that encapsulates the TensorFlow Lite interpreters and configuration settings.

```go
type BirdNET struct {
    AnalysisInterpreter *tflite.Interpreter  // Interpreter for the main bird identification model
    RangeInterpreter    *tflite.Interpreter  // Interpreter for the range filter model
    Settings            *conf.Settings       // Application configuration settings
    ModelInfo           ModelInfo            // Information about the current model
    TaxonomyMap         TaxonomyMap          // Mapping of species codes to names and vice versa
    TaxonomyPath        string               // Path to custom taxonomy file, if used
    mu                  sync.Mutex           // Mutex for thread safety
}
```

### Analysis Functionality

The package provides methods for analyzing audio samples and producing detection results:

- `Predict()` - Performs inference on audio samples to detect bird species
- `ProcessChunk()` - Processes a chunk of audio data, returning structured observation notes
- `EnrichResultWithTaxonomy()` - Adds taxonomy information to detection results

### Model Registry

The package includes a model registry system to support different BirdNET models:

```go
// ModelInfo represents metadata about a BirdNET model
type ModelInfo struct {
    ID               string   // Unique identifier for the model
    Name             string   // User-friendly name
    Description      string   // Description of the model
    SupportedLocales []string // List of supported locale codes
    DefaultLocale    string   // Default locale if none is specified
    NumSpecies       int      // Number of species in the model
    CustomPath       string   // Path to custom model file, if any
}
```

Key functions:
- `DetermineModelInfo()` - Identifies model type from filepath or model identifier
- `IsLocaleSupported()` - Validates if a locale is supported by the model

### Label Files

The package exclusively uses the V2.4 format label files, which contain species names in the format "ScientificName_CommonName" and are available in multiple languages.

The language-specific files follow the naming pattern `BirdNET_GLOBAL_6K_V2.4_Labels_<locale>.txt`, where `<locale>` is the locale identifier (e.g., `en_uk`, `de`, `fr`).

The package handles two locale formats:
- Hyphenated format in the API (e.g., `en-uk`, `pt-br`): Used in settings and code
- Underscore format in filenames (e.g., `en_uk`, `pt_BR`): Used in label filenames

The system automatically converts between these formats, allowing users to specify locales with hyphens while the files use underscores. For locales with region codes (like `pt-br`), the region part is also capitalized in the filename format (e.g., `pt_BR`).

Label files are embedded directly in the binary using Go's `embed` package, eliminating the need for external files during deployment.

Key functions:
- `GetLabelFileData()` - Loads the appropriate label file based on model version and locale
- `loadEmbeddedLabels()` - Loads embedded label files based on the model and locale
- `loadExternalLabels()` - Allows loading custom label files from external sources

### Taxonomy Integration

The package provides integrated eBird taxonomy data to enhance species identification:

```go
// TaxonomyMap is a bidirectional mapping between eBird codes and species names
type TaxonomyMap map[string]string
```

Key functions:
- `LoadTaxonomyData()` - Loads taxonomy data from embedded or custom file
- `GetSpeciesCodeFromName()` - Gets eBird code for a species name
- `GetSpeciesNameFromCode()` - Gets species name for an eBird code
- `SplitSpeciesName()` - Splits species name into scientific and common parts
- `EnrichResultWithTaxonomy()` - Adds taxonomy information to detection results

Example usage of taxonomy enrichment:
```go
scientific, common, code := bn.EnrichResultWithTaxonomy(result.Species)
fmt.Printf("Species: %s (%s), eBird code: %s, Confidence: %.2f\n", 
    common, scientific, code, result.Confidence)
```

### Range Filtering

The package implements a sophisticated range filtering system that uses location and seasonal data to filter bird species predictions:

- `predictFilter()` - Applies TensorFlow model to predict species based on location and time
- `GetProbableSpecies()` - Filters and sorts bird species based on location-specific scores
- `BuildRangeFilter()` - Updates the range filter with current probable species

The range filtering system uses a specialized TensorFlow Lite model that takes three inputs:
- Latitude (float)
- Longitude (float)
- Week number (float, 1-52)

This helps reduce false positives by filtering out species that are unlikely to be present in a given location during a particular season.

### Results Management

The package includes a queuing system for handling results from audio analysis:

- `Results` struct - Contains detection results and related metadata
- `ResultsQueue` - Channel for sending analysis results to consuming components

## Embedded Resources

The package embeds several key resources:

- TensorFlow Lite models for bird species identification:
  - `BirdNET_GLOBAL_6K_V2.4_Model_FP32.tflite` - Primary model for species identification
  - `BirdNET_GLOBAL_6K_V2.4_MData_Model_FP16.tflite` - Legacy range filter model
  - `BirdNET_GLOBAL_6K_V2.4_MData_Model_V2_FP16.tflite` - Updated range filter model

- Taxonomy and label data:
  - `eBird_taxonomy_codes_2021E.json` - eBird taxonomy mapping between species codes and names
  - `data/labels/V2.4/*.txt` - V2.4 label files in multiple languages

## Usage

A typical usage pattern involves:

```go
// Create new BirdNET instance
bn, err := birdnet.NewBirdNET(settings)
if err != nil {
    // Handle error
}

// Process audio chunk
results, err := bn.Predict(audioSample)
if err != nil {
    // Handle error
}

// Process results with taxonomy information
for _, result := range results {
    scientific, common, code := bn.EnrichResultWithTaxonomy(result.Species)
    fmt.Printf("Species: %s (%s), eBird code: %s, Confidence: %.2f\n", 
        common, scientific, code, result.Confidence)
}
```

## Thread Safety

The package implements thread safety mechanisms to allow usage in concurrent contexts:

- A mutex protects the TensorFlow interpreters from concurrent access
- The results queue provides a thread-safe way to communicate results between components

## Performance Optimizations

The package includes several optimizations for performance:

- Automatic thread count determination based on available CPU cores
- Optional XNNPACK delegate support for accelerated inference
- Performance core optimization on supported hardware
- Efficient queue system to handle analysis results asynchronously

## Cross-Platform Support

The package is designed to work on multiple platforms:
- Linux (including Raspberry Pi and other SBCs)
- macOS
- Windows
